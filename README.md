## 🔥 Firebase Setup Guide

To make the app work, you need to set up a Firebase Project:

1.  Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Create a new project.
3.  **Authentication:** Enable **Google Sign-In**.
4.  **Firestore Database:** Create a database in **Production Mode**.
5.  **Firestore Rules:** Update your rules to allow authenticated users to read/write:
    ```javascript
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
